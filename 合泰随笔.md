* Sleep-Quality-Analysis(睡眠质量检测)[abhishek-sahu-99/Sleep-Quality-Analysis: Sleep stage classification is one of the critical methodologies for the diagnosis of sleep-related diseases and complications. The conventional method of categorization is quite clumsy and timeconsuming. This project aims to devise a deep learning and machine learning model for automatic classification of sleep stage, hence, removing the barrier of conventional method and expert ubiquity. In this work, we have considered a database that carries 197-night sleep polysomnographic data. Moreover, we aimed to classify this data into stages W, N1, N2, N3 and N4 as mentioned in the AASM standard. In addition to that, we have selected the EEG FpzCz channel because of its better quality and used an epoch time of 30 seconds for signal processing. We have used four machine learning and deep learning methods, namely CNN-CNN, CNN-LSTM, Random Forest, and XGBoosting, with 82%, 87%, 51%, and 59%, respectively. This report has depicted a roadmap of the EEG-based sleep stage scoring method by implementing the state of art methods. In conclusion, using better signal processing techniques will increase the overall performance and accuracy of the model. (github.com)](https://github.com/abhishek-sahu-99/Sleep-Quality-Analysis)
* 人体姿态摔倒姿态检测[Health-Devices-Research-Group/Posture-and-Fall-Detection-System-Using-3D-Motion-Sensors: This work presents a supervised learning approach for training a posture detection classifier, and implementing a fall detection system using the posture classification results as inputs with a Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor. The Kinect v2 skeleton tracking provides 3D depth coordinates for 25 body parts. We use these depth coordinates to extract seven features consisting of the height of the subject and six angles between certain body parts. These features are then fed into a fully connected neural network that outputs one of three considered postures for the subject: standing, sitting, or lying down. An average classification rate of over 99.30% for all three postures was achieved on test data consisting of multiple subjects where the subjects were not even facing the Kinect depth camera most of the time and were located in different locations. These results show the feasibility to classify human postures with the proposed setup independently of the location of the subject in the room and orientation to the 3D sensor.
